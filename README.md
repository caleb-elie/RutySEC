## About RUTYSec
**RUTYSec** is a powerful password security tool designed to generate secure passwords, hash passwords, check if they‚Äôve been leaked in data breaches, and perform dictionary attacks for penetration testing. Built with **Python**, it integrates **encryption, hashing, and OSINT techniques** to enhance password security assessments.

## Features
- **Generate strong passwords** (customizable length)
- **Hash passwords** using MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-512
- **Check password leaks** via Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API
- **Dictionary attack** using a custom wordlist or the RockYou wordlist
- **AES encryption** used internally to secure stored sensitive data
